## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

- 🧷 I can write **C#** – but Stack Overflow deserves most of the credit  
- 🗃️ I use **SQL** – usually with lots of trial and error  
- 🌐 I know **HTML**, but CSS still makes me question life choices  
- 🌬️ Currently learning **Tailwind CSS** – because regular CSS wasn’t confusing enough

---

## 🧠 What I actually do

- 💥 Mostly learning by breaking things  
- 🧪 Sometimes things work and I pretend it was on purpose  
- 🧸 Making small tools and ideas that probably no one will use (but I will!)

## 🔍 Currently exploring

> 🎨 `Tailwind CSS` – why fight CSS when I can build beautiful layouts faster?

Also thinking a lot about:
- 🧱 component-first thinking  
- 🧼 the difference between clean code and clever code  
- ⚙️ automation as a superpower
