<h2 align="center">Ni7i – curious mind in code</h2>

> „I don't just write code – I craft logic, explore systems, and shape ideas into reality. I mean i try it...:)“

### Who am I?

- I can write **C#** – but Stack Overflow deserves most of the credit  
- I use **SQL** – usually with lots of trial and error  
- I know **HTML**, but CSS still makes me question life choices  
- Currently learning **Tailwind CSS** – because regular CSS wasn’t confusing enough

---

### What I actually do

- Mostly learning by breaking things  
- Sometimes things work and I pretend it was on purpose  
- Making small tools and ideas that probably no one will use (but I will!)
