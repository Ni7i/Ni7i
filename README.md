### 👨‍💻 Who am I?

- 🧷 I can write **C#** – but Stack Overflow deserves most of the credit  
- 🗃️ I use **SQL** – usually with lots of trial and error  
- 🌐 I know **HTML**, but CSS still makes me question life choices  
- 🌬️ Currently learning **Tailwind CSS** – because regular CSS wasn’t confusing enough

---

### 🧠 What I actually do

- Mostly learning by breaking things  
- Sometimes things work and I pretend it was on purpose  
- Making small tools and ideas that probably no one will use (but I will!)

### 🔍 Currently exploring

> `Tailwind CSS` – why fight CSS when I can build beautiful layouts faster?

Also thinking a lot about:
- component-first thinking
- the difference between clean code and clever code
- automation as a superpower
